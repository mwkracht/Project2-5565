Project 2 Code base

Introduction:
This is our code base for Project 2. The main files are:
dl_client.cpp
dl_server.cpp
FTP.cpp
FTP.h
TCP.cpp
TCP.h
OrderedList.cpp
OrderedList.h
Makefile
UTrans.cpp
UTrans.h

If major problems arise, debugging statements can be enabled by uncommenting the definition of DEBUG and ERROR in TCP.h (lines 34 & 35). Lines 36-39 can also be used to test the different features on top of GBN that were added to create the TCP Reno implementation.

FR_FLAG - fast retransmit
BUF_FLAG - out of order buffering
CW_FLAG - congestion window & window estimation
RTT_FLAG - RTT estimation


Compiling:
To make our project simply use the provided make file and the commands 'make', 'make clean all'. This file builds both dl_client and dl_server.


Running
Each of the executables (dl_client and dl_server) should be run with the command arguments given in the project, i.e:
dl_client <hostname> <port> <filename>
dl_server <port>
